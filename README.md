# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My nickname is **Erghel** - I'm a ex-**Browser Extensions Developer** now I'm a **JavaScript Developer** (**Backend**) (also had experience in _Manual Testing_ and _Frontend Developing_). 

I love to write scripts/code in different scripting and not so popular programming languages.

## Projects:
- [[**SearXNG Web Extension**](https://github.com/Erghel/SearXNG-Web-Extension) | [**Mozilla Addon Page**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/searxng-search/)] - A browser extension that will change your primary search engine to SearXNG.
