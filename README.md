# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My nickname is **Erghel** - I'm a ex-**Browser Extensions Developer** (also had experience in _Manual Testing_ and _Frontend Developing_). 

I like to write scripts/code in **VBScript**, **Ruby**, **PHP** and **Perl**.

## Projects:
- [[**Privacy Search Companion**](https://github.com/Erghel/Privacy-Search-Companion) | [**Mozilla Addon Page**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-companion/)] - A browser extension that allows you to choose one of the anonymous search engines for your query.
