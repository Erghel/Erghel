# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My nickname is **Erghel** - I am a **Web & Browser extension developer**. In the future I want to become a **specialist in information security of web applications**.

## Projects:
   [[**Privacy Search Companion**](https://github.com/Erghel/Answerius) | [**Mozilla Addon Page**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-companion/)] - A browser extension that allows you to choose one of the anonymous search engines for your query.
   
   [[**Pale RKN**](https://github.com/Erghel/PaleRKN)] - A browser extension that removes annoying plaques from **Roskomnadzor**.
